# AI-Blockchain-Based-Supply-Chain-Tracker
A smart supply chain system that uses AI to forecast delays, fraud risks, or demand, while blockchain stores immutable supply chain events (shipment records, inspection reports).

Technologies:
1. AI: Predictive models (sklearn, XGBoost)
2. Blockchain: Hyperledger Fabric or Ethereum
3. Frontend: Dashboard with real-time data

This project is an enterprise-level application with logistics and transparency needs in real-world industries.
